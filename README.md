# Support Desk App
Final project of "React Front To Back" course by Brad Traversy

Support Desk is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) along with Redux Toolkit for state management. It provides a platform for managing and resolving support tickets.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Creation and management of support tickets
- Real-time updates on ticket status and assignments
- User-friendly interface for seamless ticket management

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing ticket and user information
- Express.js: Backend framework for building the RESTful API
- React: Frontend library for building the user interface
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for running the backend server
- Redux Toolkit: State management library for managing application state

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/support-desk.git`
2. Install dependencies for the backend: `cd support-desk/backend && npm install`
3. Install dependencies for the frontend: `cd ../frontend && npm install`
4. Set up environment variables: Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and provide the necessary environment variables (NODE_ENV, PORT, MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET)
5. Start the development server: In terminal 'npm run dev' to start backend and frontend concurrently
6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application
